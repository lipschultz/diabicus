- When calculations take a while, provide indication that the calculation is still being done
- Make audio/video disco
- Show result to larger number of decimal places before switching to scientific notation
- Investigate better calculation timeout
    * Preferably cross-platform and sub-second timeout
- Additional buttons:
    * on left (since it's next to the numbers), add additional constants
        * pi, tau, e, i, ... (include physics/chemistry constants?)
    * on right, "lesser-used" functions
        * '*10^'
        * trig
        * mod
    * around the input/output
        * configuration options
- when picking a fact to display, negatively weight commonly- or recently-used facts
