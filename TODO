- When calculations take a while, provide indication that the calculation is still being done
- Make audio/video disco
- Investigate better calculation timeout
    * Preferably cross-platform and sub-second timeout
- Additional buttons:
    * on left (since it's next to the numbers), add additional constants
        * pi, tau, e, i, ... (include physics/chemistry constants?)
    * on right, "lesser-used" functions
        * '*10^'
        * trig
        * mod
        * to-int (or round)
    * around the input/output
        * configuration options
            * select audio source(s)
            * select number fact source(s)
            * select number fact category(s)
            * length of disco
        * modes (e.g.
        * maintain "score" of calculator usage -- how is "score" defined?
- when picking a fact to display, negatively weight commonly- or recently-used facts
- easter egg music
- superscript exponents in output (and number fact)
- how to handle multi-argument functions (e.g. round)
- why isn't 6^495259 caught as a too-large number to compute?
